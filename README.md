## System Architecture with Diagram (HW+SW) 
### Wrist-Worn Phone Tracker
**Short Description**: A wrist-worn phone tracker when your phone exceeds a distance of 20 meters, it will vibrate and flash a yellow light, and if it goes beyond 50 meters, it will flash a red light, reminding you that your phone has been left behind. The distance between tracker and phone would be displayed with stepper-motor-driven gauge needle. There is a heartbeat sensor in the tracker to detect whether you are wearing the device.
